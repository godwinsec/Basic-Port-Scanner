This Python script serves as a fundamental tool I developed for my studies in BSc Honours Cybersecurity at the Open University, UK. The port scanner allows users to assess the security posture of a network by scanning a specified IP address for open ports within a given range. Utilizing multithreading techniques, the script enhances scanning efficiency, providing valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities.

Key Features:
Interactive Input: Users are prompted to enter an IP address, start port, end port, and number of threads for customization of the scanning parameters.
Multithreaded Scanning: Implemented with ThreadPoolExecutor from Pythonâ€™s concurrent.futures module to concurrently scan multiple ports, optimizing performance.
Port Status Detection: Uses socket connections to determine whether each port is open or closed.
Results Display: Outputs a list of open ports discovered during the scan, facilitating rapid identification of accessible services.

This project aligns with the coursework and practical skills development required in my BSc Honours Cybersecurity program at the Open University, UK. It demonstrates proficiency in network security fundamentals and software development techniques essential for assessing and securing network infrastructures.

Contributions:
Contributions and feedback are encouraged to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of the port scanner. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements or new features.
